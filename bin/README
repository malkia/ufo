	The bin folder contains precompiled executables and dynamic libraries, 
organized per operating system ($OS), then architecture ($ARCH), like this:

		bin/$OS/$ARCH/...
		
	OSX and iOS are compiled as universal (fat) binaries, hence only:

        	bin/$OS

	Operating systems:
		- Windows (Linked with MSVCRT.DLL, MSVCP60.DLL, should work on Windows 2000+. Tested on XP, Windows 7)
		- OSX     (i386, x86_64, should work on Mac OS X 10.4. Tested on 10.7)
		- iOS     (Universal binaries for armv6, armv7 and the simulator i386. Tested with 5.00)
		- Linux   (i386, x864_64, armv7l. Tested with 11.04 (x86), and Ubuntu 10.10 (arvm7l - efika mx))
		- Android (arm) - Compiler right now using android-ndk-r6 for Android 2.2 (platform-8)
		
	Architecutures:
		- x86     (i386)
		- x64     (x86_64, also called amd64)
		- arm     (armv6, armv7, arvm7l)
